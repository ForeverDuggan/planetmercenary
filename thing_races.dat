<!-- This file contains the assortment of races for the game system. The special
      advantages of each race are conferred through a combination of scripts and
      automatic assignment of special abilities. All special abilities are assigned
      via the bootstrapping of the ability, resulting in the ability being
      automatically assigned to the actor whenever the race is selected. If an ability
      is both user-selected AND conferred by a race, the ability only appears a single
      time because it all abilities are "unique".
