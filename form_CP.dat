<!-- This file contains the definition of the "tacManip" form for the game system.
      The "tacManip" form represents the form where the user can apply damage and
      other in-play effects to a character. This form is accessed via the Tactical
      Console and not part of the normal Hero Lab interface for a character.

      This form is shown as a standalone form, so the form must specify its own
      dimensions. No sizing information is externally provided.

      In general, the "tacManip" form should contain access to damage tracking,
      key resource utilization, and any other in-play effects that will often be
      needed when the user is focused on the Tactical Console.

      All public visual elements used with this form start with the prefix "tac"
      to associate them with the form.

      NOTE! Unlike most other forms, the unique id of the "tacManip" form is NOT
      specially recognized by Hero Lab. Instead, the form is explicitly identified
      for use within the Tactical Console. As such, the id may be changed.
